# Peeware, The new custom UI for Synapse Z
Why does synapse z look so ugly by itself? I have no idea so instead i decided to make an external UI with an actually good editor + lsp.

# What is Peeware for?
Peeware is for developers mainly who want a nicer experience when programming. This also adds some extra stability to the current synapse Z by cutting out some of the steps and keeping it up longer without fucking your roblox client.
